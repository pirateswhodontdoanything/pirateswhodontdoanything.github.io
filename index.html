        <h2>Freshman in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a freshman at Bob Jones University studying communications. When I'm home in Massachusetts, I work at On Target Miniatures.</p>
         <p>
           My pride and joy is my horse, a senior Arabian mare named Honey. I have ridden horses for around 12 years, and I got Honey 4 years ago. Taking care of her is always the hightlight of my day.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I also enjoy hiking, biking, and backpacking, as well as curling up with a good book and a cup of tea.
